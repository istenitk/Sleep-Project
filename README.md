# Analysis of Sleep Hygiene in an IoT Sensor Network
Sleep Project 2017
The primary objective of the project is to monitor
the correlation of sleep quality and environmental
factors (Sleep Hygiene) via data collected from air
quality, light, temperature and humidity sensors.



This forms an Internet of Things sensor network
hosted on a Raspberry Pi server. By analysing
the data thus obtained, meaningful results are
hoped to be derived. This can be extended to
applications in:
- Sleep tracking device
-Sleep quality analysers
-Smart alarms
